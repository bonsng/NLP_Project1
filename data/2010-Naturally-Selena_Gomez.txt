How you choose to express yourself,
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally.

You follow what you feel inside,
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmh, it comes naturally.

And it takes my breath away,
What you do, so naturally.

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know it's meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
Bay-bay-baby.

You have a way of moving me,
A force of nature, your energy,
It comes naturally, (You know it does)
It comes naturally. (Mmmm yeah)

And it takes my breath away, (Everytime)
What you do, so naturally.

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know its meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
Bay-bay-baby.

When we collide, sparks fly,
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away.
(You are!)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning,
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting,
When you know its meant to be.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
When you're with me, baby.
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally,
Bay-bay-baby
