Sometimes we fall down, can’t get back up
We’re hiding behind skin that’s too tough
How come we don’t say "I love you," enough
'Till it’s too late, it’s not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won’t come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we’re all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would’ve done?

(Chorus)
Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we’ve been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that’s ticking
Gotta live like we’re dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell ‘em that we love ‘em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we’re dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there’ll be no one on the line

(Chorus)

Like we’re dying (x4)

(Chorus)

You never know a good thing 'til it’s gone
You never see a crash 'til its head on
Why we think we're right when we’re dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it’s gone

(Chorus)

Like we’re dying (x4)

(Chorus)
